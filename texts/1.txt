How to communicate? The telephone perhaps? Do you have a telephone
in your room at the age of 10? Even so, wherever the phone is you'll be
overheard. Bla bla bla. If your family personal computer is hooked into a phone
line, it might offer soundless help, but again, it's not in your room.
Bla.

String line = "This order was placed for QT3000!OK?";
Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("(.*?)(\\d+)(.*)");
Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(line);
while (matcher.find()) {
    System.out.println("group 1: " + matcher.group(1));
    System.out.println("group 2: " + matcher.group(2));
    System.out.println("group 3: " + matcher.group(3));
}

И т.д. и т.п. пиво водка сигареты.
Вестимо.

String line = "This order was placed for QT3000!OK?";
Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("(.*?)(\\d+)(.*)");
Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(line);
while (matcher.find()) {
    System.out.println("group 1: " + matcher.group(1));
    System.out.println("group 2: " + matcher.group(2));
    System.out.println("group 3: " + matcher.group(3));
}

That's the whole case.
No, it is not. Pair of new sentences! With roar?

Code:
//put some code
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}

And here goes some sentence.
